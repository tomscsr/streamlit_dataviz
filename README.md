#  France's Vacant Housing Crisis - Data Storytelling Dashboard

An interactive data storytelling application analyzing vacant housing patterns across France from 2020 to 2025. This Streamlit dashboard provides comprehensive insights into the geography, trends, and policy implications of France's vacant housing landscape.

##  Overview

France faces a housing paradox: while millions struggle to find affordable housing, hundreds of thousands of properties sit emptyâ€”some for years. This dashboard explores:

- **The Scale**: How many vacant properties exist and where?
- **The Trend**: Is vacancy increasing or decreasing over time?
- **The Geography**: Which regions are most affected?
- **The Chronicity**: How many properties are vacant long-term (2+ years)?
- **The Implications**: What does this mean for housing policy?

##  Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone or download this repository**

```bash
cd streamlit_dataviz
```

2. **Install dependencies (pinned)**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Get the data (download or verify existing)**

Option A â€” download with script (recommended):

```powershell
# Set dataset URLs
$env:LOVAC_DEPT_URL = "https://.../lovac_opendata_dep.csv"
$env:LOVAC_COMMUNE_URL = "https://.../lovac-opendata-communes.csv"
python scripts/data_download.py
```

Option B â€” manual: place the CSVs into `data/` yourself.

Ensure the following files are in the `data/` folder:
- `lovac_opendata_dep.csv` (Department-level data)
- `lovac-opendata-communes.csv` (Commune-level data)

4. **Run the application**

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

5. **Open in browser**

The app will automatically open in your default browser at `http://localhost:8501`

##  Reproducibility & Packaging

- Dependencies are pinned in `requirements.txt` for deterministic installs.
- Simple run instructions are provided above (no Makefile required). If you prefer a one-liner workflow, you can:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv; .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1; pip install -r requirements.txt; python scripts/data_download.py; streamlit run app.py
```

- A small `scripts/data_download.py` fetches the CSVs using environment variables or CLI flags and caches to `data/` (skips if files already exist).
- `seeds.json` contains deterministic constants (e.g., random seed) should you add any sampling or randomized examples later.

##  Data Source

**Dataset**: LOVAC (Logements Vacants) - French Vacant Housing Observatory  
**Portal**: [data.gouv.fr](https://www.data.gouv.fr)  
> Please replace the placeholders in `scripts/data_download.py` or environment variables with the official dataset resource URLs from data.gouv.fr for full reproducibility.
**License**: Open License 2.0 (Licence Ouverte)  
**Coverage**: 2020-2025 (annual data)  
**Granularity**: 
- 101 departments (mÃ©tropole + overseas)
- ~35,000 communes (municipalities)

### Metrics Tracked

- `pp_total`: Total number of properties
- `pp_vacant`: Number of vacant properties
- `pp_vacant_plus_2ans`: Properties vacant for 2+ years (structural vacancy)

### Data Limitations

- Small values suppressed with 's' to protect privacy
- Overseas territories may have incomplete data
- Data relies on tax declarations (potential lag)
- Vacancy definitions may vary by jurisdiction

##  Key Insights

1. **The Two Frances**: Urban shortage vs. rural surplus
2. **Chronic Vacancy**: Over 50% vacant for 2+ years
3. **Growing Problem**: Vacancy increasing faster than housing stock
4. **Local Variation**: Significant differences even within regions
5. **Size Matters**: Smaller communes face greatest challenges

##  Technical Details

### Performance Optimizations

- **Caching**: `@st.cache_data` for expensive operations
- **Pre-aggregation**: National/department summaries computed once
- **Efficient filtering**: Pandas operations optimized
- **Lazy loading**: Data loaded only when needed

### Best Practices Implemented

 Modular code structure (sections, utils)  
 Consistent styling (centralized color scheme)  
 Error handling and user feedback  
 Responsive design (works on desktop/tablet)  
 Accessible visualizations (alt text, labels)  
 Reproducible analysis (deterministic)  
 Documented assumptions and limitations
