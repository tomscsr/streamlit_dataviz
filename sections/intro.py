        **France faces a housing paradox**: while millions struggle to find affordable housing, 
        hundreds of thousands of properties sit empty‚Äîsome for years. This data story explores:
        
        - üìä **The scale**: How many vacant properties exist and where?
        - üìà **The trend**: Is vacancy increasing or decreasing over time?
        - üó∫Ô∏è **The geography**: Which regions are most affected?
        - ‚è±Ô∏è **The chronicity**: How many properties are vacant long-term (2+ years)?
        - üíº **The implications**: What does this mean for housing policy?
        
        Understanding vacant housing is crucial for urban planning, social equity, and 
        environmental sustainability. Empty homes represent wasted resources and missed 
        opportunities to address housing shortages.

    ### What is Housing Vacancy?
    
    A property is considered **vacant** when it is:
    - Not occupied as a primary or secondary residence
    - Available for sale or rent, but currently empty
    - Awaiting renovation or demolition
    - Held vacant for other reasons (inheritance disputes, speculation, etc.)
    
    ### Why Do Properties Become Vacant?
    
    Common reasons include:
    - **Economic factors**: Rural depopulation, urban-rural migration
    - **Market dynamics**: Properties too expensive or in poor condition
    - **Regulatory issues**: Complex inheritance, administrative delays
    - **Speculation**: Investors holding properties for value appreciation
    - **Structural problems**: Buildings requiring major renovations
    
    ### The 2+ Year Threshold
    
    Properties vacant for **more than 2 years** are considered **structurally vacant**‚Äî
    indicating deeper issues beyond temporary market transitions. These represent the 
    most problematic cases from a policy perspective.

    This dashboard uses **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and **descriptive statistics** to:
    
    1. **Aggregate** national-level trends from department data
    2. **Compare** vacancy rates across departments and regions
    3. **Identify** outliers and patterns in the data
    4. **Visualize** geographic and temporal distributions
    5. **Classify** departments by vacancy severity
    
    All calculations are transparent and reproducible. Code is available in the repository.
